First step is to circumvene the voltage regulator

To reduce the power consumption of the arduino UNO, the voltage regulator can be bypassed by connecting a 5V power supply to 5V pin and GND2 pin.

A possible power source for the 5V could be the LM2825N chip or the MIC5205

Second step is to remove the power led light from the Arduino Uno

Third step is to include sleep mode,
Wake it up every 8 seconds, and then when a timer passes a certain value perform the measurement. More information can be found in this

Another option could to make a barebone arduino clone

Power source
Use mosfet to switch power to the ranging sensor and the GSM source. 
Use a linear regulator to reduce the input voltage to 4.8V for the gsm and the ranging sensor
Use a simple voltage divider to create a 3.3 reference voltage rail
Use a low quiescent current switching regulator for to drive the arduino.
